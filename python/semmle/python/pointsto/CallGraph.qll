/**
 * Context-sensitive call-graph.
 * 
 * NOTE: Since an "invocation" contains callsite information
 * and a path back to its ancestor calls, the "invocation" call-graph must be a tree.
 * This has two important consequences:
 *    1.  The graph is incomplete; it has quite limited depth in order to keep the graph to a sensible size.
 *    2.  The graph is precise. Since different invocations are distinct, there can be no "cross-talk" between 
 *        different calls to the same function.
